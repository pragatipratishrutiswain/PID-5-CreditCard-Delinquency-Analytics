## 💡 What is exploratory data analysis?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the first step in understanding a dataset before applying any predictive models or making business decisions.<br>
EDA helps analysts uncover patterns, trends, inconsistencies, and missing values to ensure data quality and reliability.<br>

In the context of financial services, EDA plays a crucial role in risk assessment, allowing teams to identify key factors contributing to credit card delinquency and build stronger prediction models. 

### Here is why EDA matters in predicting delinquency:

🚀 Ensures data integrity – Identifies missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies before analysis.
🚀 Highlights patterns and anomalies – Helps detect trends in customer behavior, such as spending patterns before delinquency.
🚀 Prevents biased models – Reduces the risk of unfair treatment by ensuring diverse data representation.
🚀 Supports better decision-making – Provides Geldium’s Collections and Risk teams with clear insights for proactive customer engagement.
🚀 Without a thorough EDA process, predictive models can be built on flawed data, leading to inaccurate insights, poor risk management, and potentially unfair decision-making.
