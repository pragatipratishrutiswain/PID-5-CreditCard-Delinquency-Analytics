#UNDERSTANDING IMPUTATION: 

WHAT IS IMPUTATION?
Imputation is the process of replacing missing values/data in a dataset with reasonable or estimated values. Instead of deleting rows with missing values, imputation helps retain valuable information by replacing the missing entries with typical or representative data.
WHAT ARE MEAN, MEDIAN, AND MODE?

MEAN (AVERAGE)
The mean is calculated by adding all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of values.
Example: For values $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, $6,000:
Mean = (2000 + 3000 + 4000 + 5000 + 6000) ÷ 5 = $4,000

MEDIAN (MIDDLE VALUE)
The median is the middle number when the data is ordered from smallest to largest.
Example: For values $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, $6,000:
Median = $4,000 (the third number in the sorted list)

MODE (MOST FREQUENT)
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
Example: For values $2,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000:
Mode = $2,000 (it appears twice)
HOW IS IMPUTATION USED?

When data is missing, analysts use the mean, median, or mode to fill in those blanks, depending on the nature of the data:
- Use the MEAN if the data is well-balanced without extreme values.
- Use the MEDIAN if the data contains outliers that could skew the average.
- Use the MODE if a single value is very common and likely represents others.
