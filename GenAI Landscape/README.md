The AI landscape is where Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI) fit into financial risk modeling. Here is a brief run-down:

## 💡 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI refers to any system that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, making decisions, or processing language.<br>
It is a broad category that includes both traditional rule-based systems and Machine Learning (ML) models that improve based on data.
 
## 💡 What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine learning is a subset of AI that learns from historical data to predict future outcomes.<br>
In financial services, ML models are used for<br>
✔️ credit scoring<br>
✔️ fraud detection<br>
✔️ risk assessment

Example: A logistic regression model trained on customer repayment history to predict the likelihood of delinquency.
 
## 💡 What is Generative AI (GenAI)?
GenAI is a specialized form of AI that can <br>
✔️ create new content, such as text, images, or structured code, based on training data.
 
Unlike ML, which is designed for structured predictions, GenAI assists with
✔️ automation<br>
✔️ summarization<br>
✔️ data exploration—making it a valuable tool in EDA

Example: Using GenAI to generate a summary of credit risk trends instead of manually coding an exploratory analysis.

## I won’t be building an ML model from scratch, but I will:

📊 Explore patterns in financial data that inform risk assessment.<br>
⚙️ Use GenAI tools to summarize insights and guide predictive modeling.<br>
🌍 Understand how AI-driven predictions influence real-world decisions.
