# Understanding customer risk factors for delinquency
Now that you’ve learned how to ensure data quality and handle missing values, the next step is identifying key customer risk factors that influence credit card delinquency. Understanding these factors will help refine predictive models and improve intervention strategies.

## Why risk factors matter in financial decision-making:
Lenders assess various financial and behavioral indicators to determine whether a customer is likely to miss payments. By analyzing these factors, Geldium’s Collections team can proactively identify customers who may need early intervention, reducing financial losses and improving repayment outcomes.

## Key risk factors for delinquency
1️⃣ Payment history – Customers with a history of late or missed payments are more likely to default.<br>
2️⃣ Credit utilization rate – High usage of available credit can indicate financial stress and potential repayment issues.<br>
3️⃣ Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio – A high DTI suggests a customer may struggle to manage their financial obligations.<br>
4️⃣ Recent credit activity – A sudden increase in new credit accounts or loan applications may signal financial instability.<br>
5️⃣ Employment and income stability – Frequent job changes or inconsistent income can contribute to a higher risk of missed payments.<br>
6️⃣ Demographic trends – While AI models must avoid bias, certain patterns (e.g., younger customers with limited credit history) may require additional analysis.<br>
7️⃣ AI-driven models analyze multiple risk factors simultaneously, detecting patterns that may not be immediately obvious. However, ensuring that these models remain fair and explainable is crucial to avoiding biases in decision-making.
